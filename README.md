# 🗳 Secure and Efficient Digital Voting Platform for Remote Electoral Participation

A **web-based voting system** that leverages **face recognition technology** to ensure secure and transparent remote electoral participation. This project aims to replace traditional voting methods by providing a **biometric authentication system**, preventing voter fraud, and maintaining the integrity of the voting process.

---

## 🚀 **Features**

✅ **Face Recognition Authentication** – Voter identity verification using **VGG-Face** model  
✅ **Multi-factor Security** – Biometric + system-level security protocols  
✅ **Vote Integrity** – Prevents multiple votes by the same user  
✅ **Real-time Vote Tracking** – Ensures transparency and auditability  
✅ **Responsive UI** – User-friendly web interface for seamless participation  
✅ **Admin Panel (Optional)** – To monitor election progress
